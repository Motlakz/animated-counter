## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See the numbers rise immediately when the page is displayed on their browser window

### My Process

I replicated the basic markup from the Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube and applied my own styles for a little diversity. Then I proceeded to mimic the logical approach used to tackle the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to further establish my DOM manipulation learning, which I am still working on. I also learned the Math method used to round off numbers to avoid the use of decimals during the countdown.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including DOM Manipulation.
